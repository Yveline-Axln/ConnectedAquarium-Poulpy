# ConnectedAquarium-Poulpy
Connected object to be deployed on aquariums.  The core of this communitarian open-source solution is to provide an educational tool thanks to a connected Do-It-Yourself instrumented octopus. Indeed, this smart solutionâ€™s main purpose is to educate students from all ages and fishkeeping enthusiasts about sea life and its issues. A user-friendly app allows a live monitoring of the state of the aquarium while providing useful advice to the user and even alerting him if a problem occurs.  The project will be developed in collaboration with the biological oceanography laboratory in Banyuls-sur-Mer who will be directly benefiting from the open data generated and using it for its research and relationship with schools and public in general.
